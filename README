dontspamme

SUMMARY
dontspamme is an anti-spam, anonymous remiler tool for Google users.

A user is signing up as a member on a website. The website asks
for an email account. A lot of people hate giving out their
email addresses to websites they don't yet trust, so they often create
extra email accounts to receive the inevitable spam. With dontspamme,
a user can automatically generate a new email address, a pseudonym,
and give the pseudonym to the website. All emails sent to that
pseudonym will be relayed to the user's real email; HOWEVER, emails
that are sent from a domain that is not the original signup site
will be flagged as spam because this signup site has doubtlessly
betrayed you and sold your email. Jerks.

WHO IS THIS FOR?
dontspamme is for all Google users.
